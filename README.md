# Description:
This module had us create a backend database for an election. the database included tables for the candidates, parties affiliated with the candidates, voters who participated in the election and the vote total associated with each candidate. The backend introduced using the db.query method to establish all the route for the election application.

# Tasks
1. Build the database for the election app and set up a file structure that would seed the database with values.
2. Create a table for the candidates running in the election.
3. Create a table for the candidates party affiliation.
4. Create a table for the voters involved in the election.
5. Create a table that alllows the votes cast in the election to be counted.
6. Link the three tables together so that the candidates information, party they belong to, and how many votes they got can be displayed in the table created for the candidates.

# Tasks Achieved By
These tasks were achieved by following the lessons found in module 12 and fixing bugs in my code as they appeared while creating the database for this application.

# Built With
This application was built with Node.js, Javascript, MySQL, Sequlize, and implementing CRUD Operations to test the routes for the database.
