# Description:
This module had us create a backend database for an election. the database included tables for the candidates, parties affiliated with the candidates, voters who participated in the election and the vote total associated with each candidate. The backend introduced using the db.query method to establish all the route for the election application.

# Tasks
1. Build the database for the election app and set up a file structure that would seed the database with values.
2. Create a table for the candidates running in the election.
3. Create a table for the candidates party affiliation.
4. Create a table for the voters involved in the election.
5. Create a table that alllows the votes cast in the election to be counted.
6. Link the three tables together so that the candidates information, party they belong to, and how many votes they got can be displayed in the table created for the candidates.

# Tasks Achieved By
These tasks were achieved by following the lessons found in module 12 and fixing bugs in my code as they appeared while creating the database for this application.

# Built With
This application was built with Node.js, Javascript, MySQL, Sequlize, and implementing CRUD Operations to test the routes for the database.

# How To Run Application:
If you want to run this database for yourself on your own computer you need to follow the steps that will be listed down below.
step 1: Download the software called Node.js and MySQL. Click on the links below to download Node.js and MySQL onto your computer 
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Link for Node.js</a>
It is recommended that you click on the version of node that is recommended for most users. Open the Node.js installer once it is done downloading and click on next untill
you see the install button and click install. Follow the same instructions if you are downloading it onto a mac instead of a windows. Remember that for both systems the
recommended version for most users is strongly suggested

step 2: Clone the code for the database from its repostiory on my github account. The link to the repository on my github account is listed below
- <a href="https://github.com/Joker282855/u-develop-it">Repository Link</a>
Click the code button in the top right corner and copy the link for https. Open up your gitbash terminal in visual studio code and use the git clone command to clone the repository onto your computer. Visual studio code and gitbash are software that you will have to download onto your computer if
