# Tasks
1. Build the database for the election app and set up a file structure that would seed the database with values.
2. Create a table for the candidates running in the election.
3. Create a table for the candidates party affiliation.
4. Create a table for the voters involved in the election.
5. Create a table that alllows the votes cast in the election to be counted.
6. Link the three tables together so that the candidates information, party they belong to, and how many votes they got can be displayed in the table created for the candidates.

# Tasks Achieved By
These tasks were achieved by following the lessons found in module 12 and fixing bugs in my code as they appeared while creating the database for this application.

# Built With
This application was built with Node.js, Javascript, MySQL, Sequlize, and implementing CRUD Operations to test the routes for the database.
